# Immersive VR and Robotics for Upper Extremity Rehabilitation

This repository contains the code and data used in the study of immersive virtual reality (VR) and robotics for upper extremity rehabilitation. Our project evaluates the effectiveness of VR and robotic interfaces in enhancing motor function rehabilitation.

## Overview

The project utilizes a combination of immersive virtual reality and endpoint robotics to facilitate upper extremity rehabilitation. This research aims to provide insights into how such technologies can be effectively integrated to improve patient engagemmnety outcomes.


## Repository Structure

The data for this study includes responses from subjective questionnaires and resistance measurements from a wearable sleeve sensor, as detailed in our experimental procedures, respectively, under pre and post-questionnaires, and resistance of elbow movements in each task.

The Sleeve Data involves a knit fabric-based nanocomposite sensor sewn into a one-size-fits-all sleeve, worn on the dominant arm of participants to assess elbow joint movements during rehabilitation exercises. This piezo-resistive sensor changes its electrical resistance in response to the stretch and strain experienced during elbow flexion and extension. The resistance change data are recorded using an Arduino-based voltage divider circuit, and data is streamed to capture these variations as participants engage in different rehabilitation tasks using immersive VR and end-point robotics.
