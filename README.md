# Immersive VR and Robotics for Upper Extremity Rehabilitation

This repository contains the code and data used in the study of immersive virtual reality (VR) and robotics for upper extremity rehabilitation. Our project evaluates the effectiveness of VR and robotic interfaces in enhancing motor function rehabilitation.

## Overview

The project utilizes a combination of immersive virtual reality and endpoint robotics to facilitate upper extremity rehabilitation. This research aims to provide insights into how such technologies can be effectively integrated to improve patient engagemmnety outcomes.

## Repository Structure

The data for this study include responses from subjective questionnaires and resistance measurements from a wearable sleeve sensor, as detailed in our experimental procedures, respectively, under pre and post-questionnaires, and resistance of elbow movements in each task.
